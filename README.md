# KINARM_Utility_Test

This experiment implements a test of monetary reward utility on the Kinarm; it is a replication of the existing C++ Utility test currently in use in the lab. On each trial,  individuals must choose between two options: a fixed amount of money, or a 50:50 gamble. Assessing participant choice provides an estimate of the utility of the fixed values in terms of preference for the expected values of the gambles.
